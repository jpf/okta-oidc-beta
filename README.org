* Introduction
  Thank you for participating in Okta's OpenID Connect (OIDC) Beta.

  In this document, we will show you how to get started using OpenID
  Connect with Okta. 

  Specifically demonstrated are the following two use-cases:
  1. Using OpenID Connect to authenticate Okta users to a backend
     web server (If your familiar with SAML, this is roughly
     equivalent to "SP-initiated SAML").
  2. Using OpenID Connect with a JavaScript Single Page Application.

  If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for this
  document please contact Joël Franusic <joel.franusic@okta.com>
** FIXME: Explain what BETA means				   :noexport:
* How to run this demo
  This repository comes with code that you can run yourself to see how
  OIDC works. You can run this code locally on your machine, or you
  can deploy the code to Heroku.
** Deploy to Heroku						   :noexport:
*** TODO Add a "Deploy to Heroku" button here!
** Prerequisites
   All examples in this guide assume that you have an Okta org, API
   token, and Okta OAuth Client ID. 

   Running the code samples locally will require the use of Python and
   the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29][pip]] package manager.

   Here is how to get those things if you do not have them already:
*** Okta org
   If you do not have an Okta org, you can [[https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/][sign up for a free Developer
   Edition Okta org]].
*** Okta API token
   If you do not have an API token, follow our guide for
   [[http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html][getting a token]].
*** Okta OAuth Client ID
    :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: oauth-client-id
    :END:
    At the moment, the only way to register an OAuth client with Okta
    is via Okta's =/oauth2/= API endpoint.

    The recommended method of doing this is via [[http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/api_test_client.html][Postman]], using this
    Postman Collection for Okta's [[https://beta.getpostman.com/collections/2bece1641e75a7d4a222][Client Registration API endpoint]].

    Use the "Create OAuth Client" template in Postman, replacing data in the
    sections as appropriate for your situation. The most important
    value to change in the example JSON payload is the array value for the
    =redirect_uris= key. 

    It is important that the =redirect_uris= array contains the URL
    for the site that will be making requests against Okta. If you're
    using the instructions below, this URL will look like
    "=https://abc123de4.ngrok.io=" or
    "=https://example.herokuapp.com=".

    Don't worry if you don't yet know the URL that you'll be using
    here, you can always update the value of =redirect_uris= using an
    HTTP PUT.

    It isn't required, but we suggest that
    you also change the values for the =client_name=, =client_uri=, =logo_uri=, and =jwks_uri= keys.

    Here is an example HTTP request to create an Okta OAuth client via
    the =/oauth2/= API endpoint:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      POST /oauth2/v1/clients HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.okta.com
      Accept: application/json
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: SSWS 01A2bcDefGhI34JKlmnOp5qRstUVWXy6ZABCdefgHi

      {
          "client_name": "Example Okta OAuth Client",
          "client_uri": "https://example.com",
          "logo_uri": "https://static.example.com/logo.png",
          "redirect_uris": [
               "https://example.com/oauth/callback1",
               "https://example.com/oauth/callback2"
          ],
          "response_types": [
               "code",
               "token",
               "id_token"
          ],
          "grant_types": [
               "authorization_code",
               "implicit"
          ],
          "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
          "jwks_uri": "https://static.example.com/certs/public.jwks"
      }
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Python
    While the code samples in this guide are written in Python, you do
    not need Python to use OpenID Connect with Okta.

    To run the code samples in this project you will need a working
    copy of Python 2.7+ and the pip package manager. See this guide on
    "[[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/][Properly Installing Python]]"  for instructions for setting up
    Python on your system.
** Setup
   Once you have all the prerequisites, the next step will be do get
   this example code running. You can either run this code from your
   local machine, or by running the code from Heroku.

** Make a local copy of this repository
   Before you can make use of the code in this guide, you will need a
   local copy of the code to work from. You can either download a copy
   of this repository using the "Download ZIP" button or using the =git
   clone= command.

   Using =git clone= is the suggested method for making a local copy of
   this repository, because getting updates to this repository will be
   as easy as running =git pull origin master=.
** Running on your local machine
   With a local copy of this repository on your machine, the next step
   will be to set up the project.

   You can do this on Mac OS X and Linux by running these commands from the shell:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ virtualenv venv
     $ source venv/bin/activate
     $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   If you are using Homebrew on OS X, you /might/ need to follow the
   [[http://cryptography.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/#building-cryptography-on-os-x][Homebrew specific installation instructions]] to install the Python =cryptography= library:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ env CRYPTOGRAPHY_OSX_NO_LINK_FLAGS=1 LDFLAGS="$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/libssl.a $(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/libcrypto.a" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" pip install cryptography
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   On OS X or Linux, *replace the example values in the commands below
   with your data* and then run the modified commands in your shell to
   configure the application:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ export OKTA_API_TOKEN=00A0B12CDefGHijkLmN3OPQRsTu4VWxyzABCdEf56G
     $ export OKTA_BASE_URL=https://example.okta.com
     $ export OKTA_CLIENT_ID=aBcDEfG0HiJkL1mn2oP3
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Use this command to run the application locally on your system:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ python app.py
   #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Make the example available via HTTPS using ngrok
    As a last step, you will need to make your local copy of the
    example code available via HTTPS. You need to do this because the
    [[http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest][OpenID Connect specification requires that you do so]]. 

    The easiest way to do this is using the excellent tool "[[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]]".

    To get started with ngrok, visit the
    [[https://ngrok.com/download]["Download" page for ngrok]], download ngrok, then start it on your
    system.

    Assuming that your example code is listening on
    =http://localhost:5000=, start ngrok with the following command:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ ngrok http 5000
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    When ngrok starts, you will see a page that give you information
    on the ngrok. Look for the line that starts with *Forwarding* and
    then copy the URL that starts with "https", it will look something
    like this: =https://ab123cd4.ngrok.io= - this is the URL that you
    will use in the following steps.

** Running on Heroku
   Assuming that you've already installed the
   [[https://toolbelt.heroku.com/][Heroku Toolbelt]], here are the commands you'd use to deploy this
   application to Heroku:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ heroku create
     $ git push heroku master
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Then, configure the application using these commands below. 
   *Make sure to replace the values below with your data!*
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ heroku config:set OKTA_API_TOKEN=00A0B12CDefGHijkLmN3OPQRsTu4VWxyzABCdEf56G
     $ heroku config:set OKTA_BASE_URL=https://example.okta.com
     $ heroku config:set OKTA_CLIENT_ID=aBcDEfG0HiJkL1mn2oP3
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Finally:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ heroku open
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
** Whitelist URL in Okta
   The last thing that you will need to do is add the URL for your
   example application to the appropriate Okta whitelists. This is
   done in two places: 
   1. The OAuth client configuration in your Okta org
   2. The CORS settings in your Okta org

   If you're using ngrok or Heroku to host your example application,
   then your URL will look like this "=https://abc123de4.ngrok.io=" or
    "=https://example.herokuapp.com=".

*** Update the OAuth Client =redirect_uris= array
    If you didn't do it when you created your [[#oauth-client-id][OAuth Client ID]], you
    will need to go back to that section and follow the instructions
    to add your URL to the =redirect_uris= whitelist.

*** Update CORS configuration on the Okta web page
    You will also need to enable the URL for CORS. See 
    [[http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/enabling_cors.html][Okta's guide to Enabling CORS]] for details on how to do this.
* How it works
  The core of using Open ID Connect with your application is the
  =id_token=, which is a JSON Web Token (JWT).

  Below is an example of what a JWT looks like:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2ZXIiOjEsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5va3RhLmNvbSIsIn
    N1YiI6IjAwdTBhYmNkZWZHSElKS0xNTk9QIiwibG9naW4iOiJ1c2VybmFtZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsI
    mF1ZCI6IkFiY0RFMGZHSEkxamsyTE0zNG5vIiwiaWF0IjoxNDQ5Njk1NjAwLCJleHAiOjE0NDk2OTky
    MDAsImFtciI6WyJwd2QiXSwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNDQ5Njk1NjAwfQ.btq43W2-SOsc7BA_SyMPEKcu
    2xUYoyLuY948k6tWzZAsy__MndK9pX3WjYYMwkGqfthLjMWXMuYem2-uWcdwfDCDpWoxK4Es3N8dnsQ
    NeS_U0_FfVZfkj_OMGw28RPDLRErNAuyXFj2DegXUh74PEZcDaKSz5-17znEpXgzbT14
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  *Note:* The line breaks have been added for readability.

  A JWT is, essentially, a base64 encoded JSON object. Here is what
  the JWT above looks like after it has been decoded and validated:
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    {
      "ver": 1,
      "iss": "https://example.okta.com",
      "sub": "00u0abcdefGHIJKLMNOP",
      "login": "username@example.com",
      "aud": "AbcDE0fGHI1jk2LM34no",
      "iat": 1449695600,
      "exp": 1449699200,
      "amr": [
        "pwd"
      ],
      "auth_time": 1449695600
    }
  #+END_SRC
* Getting an id_token from Okta
  The easiest way to get an =id_token= from Okta is to use the Okta
  Sign-In Widget. Here is how to configure the Okta Sign-In Widget
  to give you an =id_token=:
  #+NAME: setup-okta-sign-in
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    function setupOktaSignIn(baseUrl, clientId) {
        return new OktaSignIn({
            baseUrl: baseUrl,
            clientId: clientId,
            authParams: {
                responseType: 'id_token',
                responseMode: 'okta_post_message',
                scope: ['openid']
            }
        });
    };
  #+END_SRC
  Note: Other valid types for =authParams.scope= are: =openid=,
  =email=, =profile=, =address=, =phone=. 
** TODO Add =groups= when appropriate				   :noexport:
** TODO How to add Social Login buttons				   :noexport:
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript :exports none
    function setupOktaSignIn(baseUrl, clientId) {
	var redirectUri = baseUrl + '/oauth2/v1/widget/callback?targetOrigin=' + window.location.href;
	return new OktaSignIn({
	    baseUrl: baseUrl,
	    clientId: clientId,
	    redirectUri: redirectUri,
	    authScheme: 'OAUTH2',
	    authParams: {
		responseType: 'id_token',
		scope: [ 'openid' ]
	    },
	    idps: [
		{
		  'type': 'FACEBOOK',
		  'id': '0FAKE0FAKE'
		}
	    ]
	});
    };
  #+END_SRC
* Use cases
  The OpenID Connect specification makes provisions for many different
  use cases. For this beta, we are support two use cases:

  1. Server-side web application
     Authenticating against a web application that runs on a server.
  2. Single Page Application
     Authenticating a client-side JavaScript application that runs in
     a web browser.

** Server-side web application 

   This use case demonstrates how to have a server-side web
   application authenticate users via OpenID Connect. If you are
   familiar with SAML, this is the same use case as "SP initiated
   SAML".

   Validating a JWT is easy. Here is how to do it in Python using the
   [[https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt#pyjwt][pyjwt]] Python library.
   
   (See [[http://jwt.io/#libraries-io][JWT.io]] for a list of JWT libraries in your favorite language.)

   The [[https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt#pyjwt][pyjwt]] library handles a lot of ancillary JWT validation by
   default. In particular, it validates the =audience= attribute,
   which means that it will return an error unless the value
   =audience= attribute matches what we pass into this method.

   #+NAME: parse-jwt
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :noweb yes
     def parse_jwt(id_token):
         rv = jwt.decode(
             id_token,
             public_key,
             <<force_rs256>>
             <<audience_client_id>>
         return rv
   #+END_SRC

   Note that we are setting two specific parameters to =parse_jwt=:
   1. Force the JWT signing algorithm to =RS256=
      
      This line forces the JWT signing algorithm to =RS256=:
      #+NAME: force_rs256
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
        algorithms='RS256',
      #+END_SRC

      We do this because it is a best practice for handling JWTs and
      is done to avoid [[https://www.chosenplaintext.ca/2015/03/31/jwt-algorithm-confusion.html][critical vulnerabilities in JSON Web Token libraries]].

   2. The OAuth Client ID

      This line sets the audience to the value of the Okta OAuth
      Client ID:
      #+NAME: audience_client_id
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
        audience=okta['client_id'])
      #+END_SRC

      Okta uses the OAuth Client ID as the audience in the
      =id_token= JWTs that it issues. We pass this value to =pyjwt= so
      that our JWTs are properly validated.
   

   Where does the =public_key= come from? It is fetched from the
   [[https://example.okta.com/oauth2/v1/keys][Okta JSON Web Key endpoint]].

   The code below demonstrations how to fetch a public key to validate
   a JWT from Okta, using the endpoint URI defined as part of the JWK
   standard.

   *Note:* This code pulls from the URI directly. It should really be
   discovering that URI from the =.well-known/openid-configuration= URL endpoint that is
   used for discovery.


   #+NAME: fetch-jwt-public-key
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def fetch_jwt_public_key(base_url=None):
         if base_url is None:
             raise Exception('base_url required')
         jwks_url = "{}/oauth2/v1/keys".format(base_url)
         r = requests.get(jwks_url)
         jwks = r.json()
         x5c = jwks['keys'][0]['x5c'][0]
         pem_data = base64.b64decode(str(x5c))
         cert = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(pem_data, default_backend())
         return cert.public_key()
   #+END_SRC

** Single Page App

   This use case demonstrates how to have a Single Page application
   authenticate users via OpenID Connect.

   The code in this example is contained in two static files:
   =templates/spa.html= for the HTML and =static/single-page.js= for
   the application JavaScript.

   The JavaScript used to demonstrate this use case is covered below:
  
   We start with the code used to initialize the Okta Sign-In Widget
   in the =spa.html= file, Note that the ={{okta.base_url}}= and
   ={{okta.client_id}}= strings are place holders for the [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][Jinja2]]
   templating engine that Flask uses to render the =spa.html=
   template.
    #+NAME: single-page-okta-config
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript :padline no
      var oktaSignIn = setupOktaSignIn('{{okta.base_url}}', '{{okta.client_id}}');
  
      $(document).ready(function () {
          renderOktaWidget();
      });
    #+END_SRC

   The rest of the code used in this demonstration is contained in the
   =single-page.js= file. 

   This demonstration application is a very simplistic and
   /unrealistic/ implementation of a Single Page Application. Instead
   of using a framework [[https://angularjs.org/][Angular]], [[http://emberjs.com/][Ember]], or [[https://facebook.github.io/react/][React]], this examples uses
   [[https://jquery.com/][jQuery]] to update the page.

   (Using jQuery is easier to understand, but you /should not/ use jQuery
   to write a production quality Single Page Application.)

   The =single-page.js= file defines three functions:
   - =renderOktaWidget()=
     This handles rendering of the Okta widget.
   - =renderLogin()=
     What gets called when a user logs in with a =status= of
     "=SUCCESS=".
   - =renderLogout()=
     What gets called when a user clicks a "Logout" button or link.

   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript :tangle static/single-page.js :noweb yes :exports none
     <<single-page-app-render-sign-in>>

     <<single-page-app-render-login>>

     <<single-page-app-render-logout>>
   #+END_SRC

   We will cover each function below.

*** =renderOktaWidget()=

    Below is the =renderOktaWidget()= function which calls the
    =renderEl= ("render El"ement) method of
    =oktaSignIn=. =renderEl= takes three arguments:
    1. =widget-location-object=
       A JavaScript object which contains the =id= of the HTML element
       that should be turned into the Okta Sign-In Widget.
    2. =widget-success-function= 
       A function that is called on successful authentications.
    3. =widget-error-function=
       A function that is called when error conditions are encountered.

    Here is what the =renderEl= function looks like at a high level:
    #+NAME: single-page-app-render-sign-in
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript 
      function renderOktaWidget() {
          oktaSignIn.renderEl(
              <<widget-location-object>>,
              <<widget-success-function>>,
              <<widget-failure-function>>
          );
      }
    #+END_SRC

    Let's cover each of those sections in detail:

    First we define the =<<widget-location-object>>= section. In this section,
    we pass in an =id= of "=okta-sign-in-widget=", which is the =id= for the =<div>= that we
    want to contain the Okta Sign-In Widget.
    #+NAME: widget-location-object
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      { el: '#okta-sign-in-widget' }
    #+END_SRC

    Next, in the =<<widget-success-function>>= section, we pass in a
    function that makes an
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)][Ajax]] request to =/users/me= using the =id_token= in the
    =Authorization= header, to validate the request. If everything
    works as expected, then we call the =renderLogin()= function with
    the user's Okta id as a parameter. 
    
    #+NAME: widget-success-function
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function (res) {
          if (res.status === 'SUCCESS') {
              console.log(res);
              $.ajax({
                  type: "GET",
                  dataType: 'json',
                  url: "/users/me",
                  beforeSend: function(xhr) {
                      xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + res.id_token);
                  },
                  success: function(data){
                      renderLogin(data.user_id);
                  }
              });
          }
      }
    #+END_SRC

    Lastly, we in the =<<widget-failure-function>>= section, which we
    pass in a very simple error handling function that just calls
    =console.log()= with the error message. This is only useful while
    developing your custom logic for the Okta Sign-In Widget and you
    will want to do something different in a production deployment.
    #+NAME: widget-failure-function
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function (err) { console.log('Unexpected error authenticating user: %o', err); }

    #+END_SRC

    This is the contents of a completed =renderOktaWidget()= function:
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript :noweb yes
      <<single-page-app-render-sign-in>>
    #+END_SRC


*** =renderLogin()=

    Below is an overview of what the =renderLogin()= function
    does:
    #+NAME: single-page-app-render-login
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript :noweb yes
      function renderLogin(user_id) {
          <<display-log-out-message>>
          <<display-logged-in-message>>
          <<display-user-id>>
      }
    #+END_SRC

    Here is what each of the sections above do:

    First, we add a "Log out" item
    to the navbar, then register a =click()= event for when the user
    clicks on "Log out":
    #+NAME: display-log-out-message
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      $('#navbar > ul').empty().append('<li><a id="logout" href="/logout">Log out</a></li>');
      $('#logout').click(function(event) {
          event.preventDefault();
          renderLogout();
      });
    #+END_SRC

    Next, we hide the "logged out" message and display the "logged in" message:
    #+NAME: display-logged-in-message
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      $('#logged-out-message').hide();
      $('#logged-in-message').show();
          
    #+END_SRC

    Lastly, in the =<<display-user-id>>= section, we hide the Okta Sign-In
    Widget append the user's Okta ID into page, then show the part of
    the page with the user's Okta ID:

    #+NAME: display-user-id
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      $('#okta-sign-in-widget').hide();
      $('#okta-user-id').empty().append(user_id);
      $('#logged-in-user-id').show();
    #+END_SRC

    *Note:* The =#okta-sign-in-widget= element can only be
    instantiated once per page, so for a Single Page Application, it
    is critical that you hide the element instead of removing it.

    Convert your code to show and hide the =#okta-sign-in-widget=
    element if your browser's JavaScript console shows an error that says:
    "Backbone.history has already been started" 

*** =renderLogout()=

    The =renderLogout()= function is essentially the opposite of the
    =renderLogin()=, it clears out the navigation bar with =empty=,
    hides the "logged in" message and shows the "logged out" message,
    hides the users Okta ID and shows the Okta Sign-In Widget. (This code
    also clears out the password field in the sign-in widget).

    #+NAME: single-page-app-render-logout
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript 
      function renderLogout() {
          $('#navbar > ul').empty();
          $('#logged-in-message').hide();
          $('#logged-out-message').show();
          $('#logged-in-user-id').hide();
          $('#okta-sign-in .okta-form-input-field input[type="password"]').val('');
          $('#okta-sign-in-widget').show();

  Want to learn more about Open ID Connect and OAuth?

  Here is what we suggest that you read to learn more:
  - Aaron Parecki's "[[https://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified][OAuth 2 Simplified]]" post.

    Start here if you don't know anything about OAuth 2.
  - Karl McGuinness' "[[http://developer.okta.com/blog/2015/12/07/oauth/][Demystifying OAuth]]" video and slides.
    
    This is a great high level guide that covers the basics of OAuth.
  - [[http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-implicit-1_0.html][OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide]]

    An official guide for implementing the "implicit" flow. Language
    agnostic and very useful for learning the details on how things work.
